# BSBI Timetable Formatter - Project Summary 6

## Project Overview
The BSBI Timetable Formatter is a web application that transforms raw Excel timetables from the BSBI school system into clean, formatted timetables suitable for information screens. The application extracts key information from complex summary texts, processes them, and presents them in a readable format with session-based themes.

## Current Implementation Status
We've successfully implemented the core data extraction logic and UI components for the proof of concept. The application currently:

1. Extracts and processes timetable data from Excel files
2. Formats the data for different session types (Morning, Noon, Afternoon)
3. Provides a preview with session-based theming
4. Allows for exporting the formatted timetable in multiple formats (PNG, PDF, Excel)

## Latest Improvements

### Enhanced Logo Presentation
- Added "Berlin School of Business & Innovation" subtitle text to the BSBI logo
- Precisely positioned the subtitle text directly under the BSBI letters
- Aligned the "B" in "BSBI" with the "B" in "Berlin School of Business & Innovation"
- Made the text responsive with different font sizes based on screen size
- Ensured proper color adaptation based on the session's theme (white on dark backgrounds, black on light backgrounds)

### Enhanced Session-Based Styling
- Implemented a full background color that permeates the entire timetable (not just the header)
- Morning: Bright blue (#4a7fcb)
- Noon: Warm yellow (#F7B32B)
- Afternoon: Dark blue (#1A365D)
- Added alternating row colors (white and light gray) for better readability
- Styled table elements with rounded corners for a modern look

### Column & Row Layout Improvements
- Implemented a CSS Grid-based layout for more precise control of the table structure
- Added vertical dividers between columns using the session color
- Added proper column width distribution (25% program, 25% module, 10% intake, 25% professor, 15% room)
- Added a horizontal divider between the header section and the timetable for better visual separation
- Improved responsive design with proper spacing and alignment

### BSBI Logo Enhancement
- Substantially increased logo size for greater visual impact
- Implemented responsive sizing across different screen sizes:
  - Small screens: 130px height
  - Medium screens: 180px height
  - Large screens: 240px height
- Maintained proper scaling with preserved aspect ratio

### Export Functionality
- Implemented PNG and PDF export with proper logo embedding
- Added cache busting and other options to ensure images load correctly in exports
- Configured html-to-image with proper parameters for high-quality exports
- Enhanced PDF-lib implementation to properly handle the embedded logo

### Other Improvements
- Fixed file path issues with the BSBI logo to ensure proper loading
- Modified the date format to display as DD-MM-YYYY
- Improved typography with appropriate font sizes for different screen elements
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with better spacing and alignment

## Special Case Handling
The application continues to handle numerous edge cases in the Excel data:

- DBA Courses
- Global MBA Programs
- Pathway One-Strategic Leadership
- Cross-cultural Management
- English for Academic Purposes
- F-Y1-T1/F-Y1-T2 Prefixes
- Professor name formatting

## Next Steps
For the next phase of development:

1. Complete any remaining UI refinements for the proof of concept
2. Test with actual BSBI timetable data to ensure proper parsing
3. Consider adding user authentication for a production version
4. Consider adding a backend database for saving timetable configurations
5. Prepare for deployment on Vercel (single region)
6. Document usage instructions
7. Implement any additional features after the proof of concept is validated

## Technical Details
The application is built with:
- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI for styling
- XLSX for Excel parsing
- html-to-image for captures
- pdf-lib for PDF generation

The project is structured to be deployment-ready for Vercel's free tier with a single region configuration.
