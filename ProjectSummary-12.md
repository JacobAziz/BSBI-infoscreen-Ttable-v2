# BSBI Timetable Formatter - Project Summary 12

## Project Overview
The BSBI Timetable Formatter is a web application that transforms raw Excel timetables from the BSBI school system into clean, formatted timetables suitable for information screens. The application extracts key information from complex summary texts, processes them, and presents them in a readable format with session-based themes.

## Implementation Status
We've successfully implemented a fully functional proof of concept with the following capabilities:

### Core Functionality
1. Excel Data Processing
   - Extracts and processes timetable data from Excel files
   - Handles both raw BSBI Excel files and app-exported Excel files
   - Parses complex summary text to extract program, module, and intake information
   - Handles special cases like DBA, Global MBA, and EAP courses

2. Session-Based Theming
   - Morning: Bright blue (#4a7fcb) theme
   - Noon: Warm yellow (#F7B32B) theme
   - Afternoon: Dark blue (#1A365D) theme
   - Full background color that permeates the entire timetable
   - Alternating row colors for better readability

3. Export Capabilities
   - PNG export with high-quality image capture at 1080x1920 resolution for info screens
   - JPG export with 90% quality for smaller file size while maintaining high quality
   - PDF export with proper dimensions and formatting
   - Excel export with structured data for easy editing
   - Re-upload support for exported Excel files

4. User Interface

4. Deployment Configuration
   - Configured the project for Vercel deployment
   - Created a vercel.json configuration file for single-region deployment
   - Set up GitHub integration for continuous deployment
   - Ensured compatibility with Vercel's free tier

### UI Components
1. File Upload Component
   - Drag-and-drop interface with react-dropzone
   - Visual feedback during file processing
   - Loading states to prevent multiple uploads
   - Error handling with specific messages for different file formats

2. Timetable Preview
   - CSS Grid-based layout for precise control
   - Proper column width distribution
   - Vertical dividers between columns
   - Horizontal divider between header and content
   - Responsive styling for all screen sizes

3. Download Buttons

   - Success notifications with guidance
   - Tooltips explaining re-upload capabilities

4. BSBI Branding
   - Enhanced logo with consistent sizing across platforms
   - Proper color adaptation based on session theme
   - Fallback text display if image fails to load

### Data Processing
1. Excel Parsing System
   - Dual parsing system for different file formats
   - `parseRawExcelFile`: handles original BSBI Excel files
   - `parseExportedExcelFile`: handles app-exported Excel files
   - Automatic format detection

2. Special Case Handling
   - DBA Courses
   - Global MBA Programs
   - Pathway One-Strategic Leadership
   - Cross-cultural Management
   - English for Academic Purposes
   - F-Y1-T1/F-Y1-T2 Prefixes
   - Professor name formatting

### Technical Implementation
The application is built with:
- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI for styling
- XLSX for Excel parsing
- html-to-image for captures
- pdf-lib for PDF generation

## Deployment Status
The project is now:
- Code complete with a fully functional proof of concept
- All core functionality implemented and working correctly
- Source code pushed to GitHub repository
- Deployed on Vercel with a single region configuration
- Continuous deployment set up from GitHub to Vercel

## GitHub Repositories
- Current active repository: https://github.com/JacobAziz/BSBI-info-scrn-arda.git

## Complete Workflow
The application provides a complete end-to-end workflow:

1. Upload raw BSBI Excel timetables or app-exported timetables
2. Configure session type (Morning, Noon, Afternoon), time, and date
3. Preview the formatted timetable with appropriate theming
4. Export to PNG/JPG (1080x1920 for info screens), PDF, or Excel format
5. Edit exported Excel files as needed
6. Re-upload edited Excel files to create new PNG, JPG, or PDF exports

## Next Steps
For future development, we could consider:
1. User authentication for a production version
2. Backend database for saving timetable configurations
3. Additional customization options for formatting
4. Enhanced filtering and search capabilities
5. Multi-language support
6. Admin dashboard for usage analytics
