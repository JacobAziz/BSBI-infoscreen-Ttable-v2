# BSBI Timetable Formatter - Project Summary 10

## Project Overview
The BSBI Timetable Formatter is a web application that transforms raw Excel timetables from the BSBI school system into clean, formatted timetables suitable for information screens. The application extracts key information from complex summary texts, processes them, and presents them in a readable format with session-based themes.

## Implementation Status
We've successfully implemented a fully functional proof of concept with the following capabilities:

### Core Functionality
1. Excel Data Processing
   - Extracts and processes timetable data from Excel files
   - Handles both raw BSBI Excel files and app-exported Excel files
   - Parses complex summary text to extract program, module, and intake information
   - Handles special cases like DBA, Global MBA, and EAP courses

2. Session-Based Theming
   - Morning: Bright blue (#4a7fcb) theme
   - Noon: Warm yellow (#F7B32B) theme
   - Afternoon: Dark blue (#1A365D) theme
   - Full background color that permeates the entire timetable
   - Alternating row colors for better readability

3. Export Capabilities
   - PNG export with high-quality image capture
   - PDF export with proper dimensions and formatting
   - Excel export with structured data for easy editing
   - Re-upload support for exported Excel files

4. User Interface
   - Modern gradient styling throughout the application
   - Card-based layout with shadows and rounded corners
   - Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
   - Light/dark mode support with useColorModeValue
   - Enhanced BSBI logo with subtitle and proper positioning

### UI Components
1. File Upload Component
   - Drag-and-drop interface with react-dropzone
   - Visual feedback during file processing
   - Loading states to prevent multiple uploads
   - Error handling with specific messages for different file formats

2. Timetable Preview
   - CSS Grid-based layout for precise control
   - Proper column width distribution
   - Vertical dividers between columns
   - Horizontal divider between header and content
   - Responsive styling for all screen sizes

3. Download Buttons
   - PNG, PDF, and Excel export options
   - Loading states during export processing
   - Success notifications with guidance
   - Tooltips explaining re-upload capabilities

4. BSBI Branding
   - Enhanced logo with increased size for visual impact
   - "Berlin School of Business & Innovation" subtitle
   - Responsive sizing across different screen sizes
   - Proper color adaptation based on session theme

### Data Processing
1. Excel Parsing System
   - Dual parsing system for different file formats
   - `parseRawExcelFile`: handles original BSBI Excel files
   - `parseExportedExcelFile`: handles app-exported Excel files
   - Automatic format detection

2. Special Case Handling
   - DBA Courses
   - Global MBA Programs
   - Pathway One-Strategic Leadership
   - Cross-cultural Management
   - English for Academic Purposes
   - F-Y1-T1/F-Y1-T2 Prefixes
   - Professor name formatting

### Technical Implementation
The application is built with:
- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI for styling
- XLSX for Excel parsing
- html-to-image for captures
- pdf-lib for PDF generation

## Deployment Status
The project is now:
- Code complete with a functional proof of concept
- Version controlled and pushed to GitHub at: https://github.com/JacobAziz/Info-screen-bsbi.git
- Ready for deployment on Vercel's free tier with a single region configuration
- Set up to be easily extended with additional features in the future

## Complete Workflow
The application provides a complete end-to-end workflow:

1. Upload raw BSBI Excel timetables or app-exported timetables
2. Configure session type (Morning, Noon, Afternoon), time, and date
3. Preview the formatted timetable with appropriate theming
4. Export to PNG, PDF, or Excel format
5. Edit exported Excel files as needed
6. Re-upload edited Excel files to create new PNG or PDF exports

## Next Steps
For future development, we could consider:
1. User authentication for a production version
2. Backend database for saving timetable configurations
3. Additional customization options for formatting
4. Automated testing for robust quality assurance
5. Additional export formats or integrations
