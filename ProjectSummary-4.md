# BSBI Timetable Formatter - Project Summary 4

## Project Overview
The BSBI Timetable Formatter is a web application that transforms raw Excel timetables from the BSBI school system into clean, formatted timetables suitable for information screens. The application extracts key information from complex summary texts, processes them, and presents them in a readable format with session-based themes.

## Current Implementation Status
We've successfully implemented the core data extraction logic and UI components for the proof of concept. The application currently:

1. Extracts and processes timetable data from Excel files
2. Formats the data for different session types (Morning, Noon, Afternoon)
3. Provides a preview with session-based theming
4. Allows for exporting the formatted timetable

## Latest Improvements

### Date Format Change
- Modified the date format in TimetablePreview from YYYY-MM-DD to DD-MM-YYYY
- Implemented using split-reverse-join pattern to transform dates
- Ensured consistent display across all outputs (preview, PNG, PDF)

### BSBI Logo Enhancement
- Substantially increased logo size for greater visual impact
- Implemented responsive sizing across different screen sizes:
  - Small screens: 130px height
  - Medium screens: 180px height
  - Large screens: 240px height
- Maintained proper scaling with preserved aspect ratio
- Retained automatic color adaptation based on session background:
  - White logo on dark backgrounds (Morning and Afternoon sessions)
  - Original logo on light backgrounds (Noon session)

### BSBI Logo Implementation
- Integrated the official BSBI logo as an image (replaced text-based logo)
- Stored the logo in the public/images directory for proper access
- Configured the logo to display properly in the center of the header

### Export Functionality
- Implemented PNG and PDF export with proper logo embedding
- Added cache busting and other options to ensure images load correctly in exports
- Configured html-to-image with proper parameters for high-quality exports
- Enhanced PDF-lib implementation to properly handle the embedded logo

### Theme & Styling
- Morning: Bright blue (#4a7fcb)
- Noon: Warm yellow (#F7B32B)
- Afternoon: Dark blue (#1A365D)
- Improved typography with appropriate font sizes for different screen elements
- Set proper column widths in the timetable for balanced content display

### Responsive Design
- Implemented responsive text sizing for all elements
- Structured the layout to maintain proper spacing on different screen sizes
- Used flexbox for reliable alignment of header elements

## Special Case Handling
The application continues to handle numerous edge cases in the Excel data:

- DBA Courses
- Global MBA Programs
- Pathway One-Strategic Leadership
- Cross-cultural Management
- English for Academic Purposes
- F-Y1-T1/F-Y1-T2 Prefixes
- Professor name formatting

## Next Steps
For the next phase of development:

1. Complete any remaining UI refinements for the proof of concept
2. Test with actual BSBI timetable data to ensure proper parsing
3. Finalize the export functionality
4. Prepare for deployment on Vercel (single region)
5. Document usage instructions
6. Implement any additional features after the proof of concept is validated

## Technical Details
The application is built with:
- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI for styling
- XLSX for Excel parsing
- html-to-image for captures
- pdf-lib for PDF generation

The project is structured to be deployment-ready for Vercel's free tier with a single region configuration.
