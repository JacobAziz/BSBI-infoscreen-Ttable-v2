# BSBI Timetable Formatter - Project Summary 9

## Project Overview
The BSBI Timetable Formatter is a web application that transforms raw Excel timetables from the BSBI school system into clean, formatted timetables suitable for information screens. The application extracts key information from complex summary texts, processes them, and presents them in a readable format with session-based themes.

## Current Implementation Status
We've successfully implemented the core data extraction logic and UI components for the proof of concept. The application currently:

1. Extracts and processes timetable data from Excel files
2. Formats the data for different session types (Morning, Noon, Afternoon)
3. Provides a preview with session-based theming
4. Allows for exporting the formatted timetable in multiple formats (PNG, PDF, Excel)
5. Supports re-uploading and processing app-exported Excel files

## Latest Improvements

### Enhanced UI with Modern Gradients
- Added elegant gradient styling throughout the application
- Created a prominent app title with gradient text and drop shadow
- Implemented card-based layout with shadows and rounded corners
- Added responsive font sizing for different screen sizes
- Enhanced overall layout with improved spacing and padding
- Implemented light/dark mode support with useColorModeValue

### Fixed Layout Issues
- Corrected the "Intake" column header breaking into two lines
- Adjusted column widths for better content display

### Support for Re-uploading App-Exported Excel Files
- Implemented dual parsing system that detects and handles both original BSBI Excel files and app-exported files
- Created separate parsing functions for different file formats:
  - `parseRawExcelFile`: handles original BSBI Excel files with Summary, Room, Staff columns
  - `parseExportedExcelFile`: handles app-exported Excel files with program, module, intake, professor, room columns
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages for each format
- Added automatic format detection to simplify the user experience

### Enhanced File Upload Component
- Added visual feedback during file processing with status indicators
- Implemented loading states to prevent multiple uploads
- Added clear messaging about supported file types
- Improved error reporting with specific messages for different file formats

### Enhanced Download Buttons
- Added loading states to show when downloads are in progress
- Added tooltip to Excel download button explaining the re-upload capability
- Added a "Pro tip" message to inform users about the workflow of editing and re-uploading Excel files
- Enhanced success notifications with guidance on next steps

### Fixed PDF Export Functionality
- Resolved the issue where PDF exports only showed a portion of the timetable
- Implemented dynamic PDF page sizing based on the timetable's aspect ratio
- Added proper image scaling and positioning with margins
- Improved image quality by increasing the pixel ratio to 3
- Ensured the entire timetable content is captured and properly centered in the PDF

### Enhanced Logo Presentation
- Added "Berlin School of Business & Innovation" subtitle text to the BSBI logo
- Precisely positioned the subtitle text directly under the BSBI letters
- Aligned the "B" in "BSBI" with the "B" in "Berlin School of Business & Innovation"
- Made the text responsive with different font sizes based on screen size
- Ensured proper color adaptation based on the session's theme (white on dark backgrounds, black on light backgrounds)

### Enhanced Session-Based Styling
- Implemented a full background color that permeates the entire timetable (not just the header)
- Morning: Bright blue (#4a7fcb)
- Noon: Warm yellow (#F7B32B)
- Afternoon: Dark blue (#1A365D)
- Added alternating row colors (white and light gray) for better readability
- Styled table elements with rounded corners for a modern look

### Column & Row Layout Improvements
- Implemented a CSS Grid-based layout for more precise control of the table structure
- Added vertical dividers between columns using the session color
- Added proper column width distribution (24% program, 24% module, 12% intake, 24% professor, 16% room)
- Added a horizontal divider between the header section and the timetable for better visual separation
- Improved responsive design with proper spacing and alignment

### BSBI Logo Enhancement
- Substantially increased logo size for greater visual impact
- Implemented responsive sizing across different screen sizes:
  - Small screens: 130px height
  - Medium screens: 180px height
  - Large screens: 240px height
- Maintained proper scaling with preserved aspect ratio

### Export Functionality
- Implemented PNG export with proper logo embedding and high-quality image capture
- Fixed PDF export to properly display the complete timetable with correct dimensions
- Added Excel export with proper formatting of timetable data
- Added cache busting and other options to ensure images load correctly in exports
- Enhanced PDF-lib implementation for proper page sizing and image embedding

## Special Case Handling
The application handles numerous edge cases in the Excel data:

- DBA Courses
- Global MBA Programs
- Pathway One-Strategic Leadership
- Cross-cultural Management
- English for Academic Purposes
- F-Y1-T1/F-Y1-T2 Prefixes
- Professor name formatting

## Complete Feature Set
The application now provides a comprehensive workflow:

1. Upload raw BSBI Excel timetables or app-exported timetables
2. Configure session type (Morning, Noon, Afternoon), time, and date
3. Preview the formatted timetable with appropriate theming
4. Export to PNG, PDF, or Excel format
5. Edit exported Excel files as needed
6. Re-upload edited Excel files to create new PNG or PDF exports

## Next Steps
For the next phase of development:

1. Test with additional BSBI timetable data to ensure proper parsing in all scenarios
2. Consider adding user authentication for a production version
3. Consider adding a backend database for saving timetable configurations
4. Prepare for deployment on Vercel (single region)
5. Document usage instructions
6. Implement any additional features after the proof of concept is validated

## Technical Details
The application is built with:
- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI for styling
- XLSX for Excel parsing
- html-to-image for captures
- pdf-lib for PDF generation

The project is structured to be deployment-ready for Vercel's free tier with a single region configuration.
